### Credits üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* Sm2 - Algorithm by Super Memo
* prompt-toolkit - TUI library. üòé

### Why ? ü§î
* Wanted a flashcard solution that uses markdown.
* I wanted to memorise useful information.
* GitHub/Gitlab/etc,.. readable flashcards.

### Installation (Unix, Windows)

#### Install with pipx
```bash
git clone git@github.com:JaDogg/sbx.git
cd sbx
pipx install .
```

#### Install with setup.py
```bash

python setup.py install
```

### Features
* It's markdown. (You can use your own editor, as long as you maintain comments in it)
* Syntax highlighting.
* List files. (leech, last one marked with lowest score, include all, etc.)
* Use your own folder structure. (Study at any level in your structure, recursive or not is up to you)
* Built in editor which shows front and back of the flashcards.
* Push your files to github and you can read them.

	* So you can practice
* [x] Keep the last sessions in a string (string stack) :)
* [ ] ~Create a new algorithm that can use a gradient descent based on past scores need minimum 5 items but if we have about 20 or more we can be more confident.~ - maybe later 
* [ ] Implement Sm2+ 
* [ ] Implement Sm4
* [x] Past stat graph
