* [x] On show or when 1-6 is clicked focus on the text box
	* So you can practice
* [x] Keep the last sessions in a string (string stack) :)
* [ ] Create a new algorithm that can use a gradient descent based on past scores need minimum 5 items but if we have about 20 or more we can be more confident. 
* [ ] Past stat graph
