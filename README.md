### Credits 🙇‍♂️
* Sm2 - Algorithm by Super Memo
* prompt-toolkit - TUI library. 😎

### Why ? 🤔
* Wanted a flashcard solution that uses markdown.
* I wanted to memorise useful information.
* GitHub/Gitlab/etc,.. readable flashcards.

### TODO:
* [ ] Plugin Support
* [ ] Configurable Keys
* [ ] Statistics
* [ ] Support ASCII drawing
* [ ] Support for different algorithms.
* [x] Support for leech detection
* [ ] Leech in info box
* [ ] Leech in different colour? 
* [x] Leech in list
* [x] Last quality zero in list
* [ ] Test with 100,000 cards
* [ ] Auto Save Plugin?

* [x] Make the scratch pad editable always
* [x] No need to have 1-6 shortcuts
* [x] On show or when 1-6 is clicked focus on the text box
	* So you can practice
* [x] Keep the last sessions in a string (string stack) :)
* [ ] Create a new algorithm that can use a gradient descent based on past scores need minimum 5 items but if we have about 20 or more we can be more confident. 
* [ ] Implement Sm2+ 
* [ ] Implement Sm4
* [ ] Past stat graph
